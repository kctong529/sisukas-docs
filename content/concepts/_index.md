- The phased planning approach

## Discovery: Finding Courses

**[How We Filter](./filtering/)** – Fast, expressive course discovery
- Information should be accessible
- Natural Boolean logic without query languages
- Filtering as a core philosophy

## Planning: Assembling Your Semester

**[Plans & The Block Model](./plans/)** – Grouping and composing
- Why course instances are partitioned into blocks
- How Plans work as exploration workspaces
- The composability principle

**[Schedule Pairs](./schedule-pairs/)** – Finding good combinations
- How one study group per block forms complete timetable options
- Ranking schedules to support informed choice

**[Decision Slots](./decision-slots/)** – Making trade-offs explicit
- Why some conflicts are unavoidable
- Explicitly choosing how you will attend
- Reflecting on repeated compromises

**[Year Timeline](./year-timeline/)** – Seeing your academic year as a whole
- Completed, ongoing, and planned studies in one view
