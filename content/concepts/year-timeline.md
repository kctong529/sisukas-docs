title: "Year Timeline"
description: "Year-level view of workload: completed, ongoing, and planned studies shown across teaching periods with no manual upkeep."

The Year Timeline is a conceptual view of your academic year. It exists to
answer a single question:

> [!TIP]
> *“What does my year look like as a whole?”*

It provides long-term context for planning, not detailed schedules or decisions.

## Why This View Exists

Students do not plan in isolation. Decisions about one semester are shaped by:

- what has already been completed,
- what is currently running,
- and what is still ahead.

Most tools force planning into short, disconnected windows. The Year Timeline
restores continuity by showing the academic year as a single structure rather
than a sequence of independent choices.

## A Familiar Mental Model

The Year Timeline is inspired by an earlier SISU timeline that many students
found intuitive for understanding workload across the year.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Sisukas adopts this mental model while removing the need for manual maintenance.
The timeline reflects reality automatically rather than requiring users to
construct it themselves.

## What the Timeline Shows

The timeline shows an academic year divided into teaching periods.
Within that structure, it places completed studies, ongoing studies, and planned studies,
so that they can be understood together, not in isolation.

## Automation by Default

Automation is a core property of the Year Timeline.

The timeline is derived entirely from your study data:

- completed courses can be imported from official SISU transcript
- planned courses appear automatically in their relevant periods
- multi-period courses are handled without manual adjustment

> [!TIP]
> The timeline is something you read, not something you maintain.

## How It Fits Into Planning

The Year Timeline sits above semester-level planning tools.
It helps you identify where attention is needed before moving on to more
detailed reasoning using Plans, Schedule Pairs, and Decision Slots.
